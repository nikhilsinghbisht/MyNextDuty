# MyNextDuty 🚀

*A community-driven career guidance and growth platform*

## 🌟 Overview

**MyNextDuty** is an open, community-powered platform designed to help people who are unsure about their next step in their career.

This idea comes from personal experience.

During my 4 years as a bachelor’s student, I often felt lost:

* I didn’t know **what to learn**
* I didn’t understand **DSA or algorithms**
* I didn’t know **how companies evaluate candidates**
* I didn’t know **how to prepare for a good job or package**
* I didn’t know **what actions to take at my current stage**

And the biggest problem was:

> *You don’t know what to do because you don’t know what you should know.*

This problem doesn’t apply only to students.
It applies to **anyone**, at **any stage of life or career**.

That’s why **MyNextDuty** is:

* 🌍 **Open to everyone**
* 🧠 **Not age-dependent**
* 🎓 **Not limited to students**
* 🤝 **Community-first**
* 💡 **Focused on guidance, clarity, and action**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

People often struggle because:

* They don’t know what skills matter at their current stage
* They don’t know how hiring actually works
* They don’t know what path fits them best
* They don’t have access to real guidance
* They learn randomly without direction

There is **no single place** that:

* Understands your **current position**
* Shows you **what to do next**
* Connects you with **people who’ve been there before**

---

## 💡 Solution

**MyNextDuty** helps users by:

* Identifying **where they currently stand**
* Providing **clear next steps**
* Connecting users with **mentors and peers**
* Encouraging **knowledge sharing**
* Building a **supportive community**

Instead of “just learning everything”, users focus on:

> **What is my next duty right now?**

## 👥 Who Is This Platform For?

* Fresh graduates
* Working professionals
* Career switchers
* Self-learners
